Proximal makes it easy to develop
[Proxy-WASM](https://github.com/proxy-wasm/spec) modules for [Envoy](https://www.envoyproxy.io)
right on your local machine (or anywhere you can run our [Docker
image](https://hub.docker.com/r/apoxy/proximal)).

### What is Proxy-WASM?

[Proxy-WASM](https://github.com/proxy-wasm/spec) (WebAssembly) is a powerful technology that enables
you to extend the functionality of modern proxies like [Envoy](https://www.envoyproxy.io) with
WebAssembly modules. By writing Proxy-WASM modules, you can write code in your L4/L7 proxy that inspects,
mutates, and routes requests as they are passing through, all in a language-independent and sandboxed
environment. It works with both HTTP and TCP-based connection and SDKs are available for
[Rust](https://github.com/proxy-wasm/proxy-wasm-rust-sdk),
[Go](https://github.com/tetratelabs/proxy-wasm-go-sdk),
[C++](https://github.com/proxy-wasm/proxy-wasm-cpp-sdk), and
[AssemblyScript](https://github.com/solo-io/proxy-runtime) (we're working on JavaScript and Python).

These standards based WebAssembly modules can be used with [Istio](https://istio.io/latest/docs/concepts/wasm/),
[MOSN](https://github.com/mosn/mosn) and
[APSIX](https://apisix.apache.org/blog/2021/11/19/apisix-supports-wasm/#how-to-use-wasm-in-apache-apisix) as well.

## Why Proximal?

Developing Proxy-WASM modules for Envoy traditionally involves cumbersome setups, complex
toolchains, and time-consuming testing iterations, frequently on a remote environment.
Proximal simplifies the development process and brings it to you local machine in a single process
environment with a friendly UI and basic REST API.

We believe that developers have been held back from adopting this incredibly powerful technology because
the developer experience for WASM and Proxy-WASM has been a little rough around the edges. Proximial is here to help.

### Key Features:

* **Local Development**: Forget about deploying to remote environments for every code change. Proximal
  allows you to develop and test your Proxy-WASM modules locally, saving you valuable time and
  effort. It features a workflow engine that compiles source code into
  WebAssembly binary (.wasm) and loads them into Envoy automatically.

* **Rapid Iterations**: Change your code and see the results almost instantaneously. Proximal continuously
  watches a working directory (even Docker mounted volumes) and triggers a rebuild/reload of your module in Envoy automatically.

* **Simplified Setup + Examples**: Setting up a development environment for Proxy-WASM can be daunting. Proximal
  streamlines the process and provides a few examples you can use to get started with minimal configuration.

* **Observability**: Debugging is easier with integrated logs capture. See requests and responses in real-time.

## Getting Started

Run via Docker container:

```shell
docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 9901:9901 -p 9088:9088 -p 18000:18000 -v `pwd`:/mnt docker.io/apoxy/proximal:latest
```

The above command mounts your current working directory at `/mnt` inside the container so you can ingest local
Proxy-WASM code (e.g. `/mnt/myprojects/myawesome-proxy-wasm-go/`). Adjust as needed.

Bound ports:
* `8080` - Web UI (see below) and REST API at `:8080/v1/` (see definitions in the [`//api`](https://github.com/apoxy-dev/proximal/tree/main/api) folder).
* `18000` - Envoy listener - test your proxy configurations by sending requests to `localhost:18000`.
* `9901` - Envoy admin UI.
* `9088` - Temporal UI (for build workflow debugging).

## Architecture

We rely on Envoy as the main [data plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forwarding_plane) processing
engine for request routing and its WebAssembly (WASI) extension engine that implements the Proxy-WASM
ABI. The default runtime is [Chromium V8](https://v8.dev) but other runtimes such as
[Wasmtime](https://wasmtime.dev),
[Wamr](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-micro-runtime), and
[WAVM](https://wavm.github.io/)
can be configured.

The control plane server is a single Go binary that combines an Envoy control plane (using xDS
protocol), a REST API server, a React app, and a [Temporal](https://temporal.io) server
(which is linked directly via the awesome [temporalite](https://github.com/temporalio/temporalite) library)
for managing build workflows. The same binary also acts as a Temporal worker and manages the Envoy process.

Internal state is supported by an embedded SQLite instance which produces an `sqlite3.db` file on local
disk. The Temporal server has its own SQLite db file - `temporalite.db`. Both of these need to be exported
via Docker volume mount if you want state persisted across Docker runs.

Compiled `.wasm` binaries are stored on local disk in the `/tmp/proximal/` directory.

HTML/CSS/JavaScript assets currently live on local filesystem but will be embedded in the binary
itself in the future.

## Known Limitations / Future Improvements

Known Limitations:

* The entire setup is a single instance, single binary deal designed for local experimentation.
  While it's possible to run it on remote host since it's packaged in Docker, replication features
  are rather lacking.
* TCP filters aren't yet supported.
* Currently Proximal supports re-triggering builds from a git source manually. Automatic build
  triggers from GitHub commit webhooks or the like aren't suppported since they would require a
  hosted solution with a stable webhook endpoint.

Roadmap:

* More SDKs + Examples - [AssemblyScript](https://github.com/apoxy-dev/proximal/issues/1),
  [C++](https://github.com/apoxy-dev/proximal/issues/2),
  [JavaScript](https://github.com/apoxy-dev/proximal/issues/3), and
  [Python](https://github.com/apoxy-dev/proximal/issues/4).
* Istio examples - show how you take these modules into an existing Istio-enabled cluster.
* K/V store integration.
* Improved logging / tracing / accounting.
* TCP and UDP filters.
